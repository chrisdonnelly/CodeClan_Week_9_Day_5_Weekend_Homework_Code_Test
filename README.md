# CodeClan_Week_9_Day_5_Weekend_Homework_Code_Test

My answer to a typical code test one might be asked to complete by a potential employer.

This test is based on the modelling of an online shopping basket that makes use of discounts. 

I approached this problem with the intent of embedding SOLID principles and an Object Orientated approach from first principles as well as adopting a test driven process.

The solution was written in Java and demonstrates use of polymorphism, interfaces and casting.
